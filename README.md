# Plant Diseases Infection Recognition
  The application has 3 main tasks:
  
•	Plant disease infection recognition: using a deep learning model, the application can recognize plant diseases in images received by the user and outputs the disease and plant type,(Resnet-50) model was used to identify the disease.

•	Disease Severity identification: using different image processing techniques, the application can identify disease severity levels on different plants and outputs the severity level to the user.

•	Provide Recommended Solutions: based on the severity and disease type, the user is provided with recommended solutions on how to treat and minimize the loss of the plants.

  Tools used: 
  
•	Flutter is used for GUI.

•	Firebase is used to implement login functionality and to provide authentication on user’s data.

•	Python: used for the deep learning models.
